      <li><p><b>Dan's Finance:</b> I took the NASD Series 2 and Series 65 tests got my Registered Investment Adviser license in PA (not too many have ever done this without the sponsorship of a company) and created a <em>Stock Selection Seminar</em> (and an <em>Introduction to Stocks</em> seminar) which I offered to teach for a nominal fee so that others could make money, too. I have retired and just manage money privately. If you are ever interested and in the area, I would be glad to do my seminar for you - for free! Just call 610-649-0750.</p></li>
